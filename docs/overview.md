## 🧠 Project Vision

🐨 Game:
The core game is currently under development, but the vision is to create a fun and engaging experience set in a gamified Australian jungle. Players will explore lush, interactive environments, embarking on a quest to find and collect koalas hidden throughout the terrain.

Koalas are adorable and rare marsupials, primarily found in Australia’s dense eucalyptus forests. In the game, they will serve as collectible characters, each with unique traits and rarity levels, encouraging players to explore, strategize, and compete for the rarest finds.

The ultimate goal is to combine exploration, collection, and adventure in a vibrant, immersive world that highlights the beauty of Australian wildlife in a playful and memorable way

🐨 Koala World aims to:

- Main idea is to create a fun and interactive platform for users to collect, trade, and explore unique digital koalas as NFTs.
- Utilize blockchain for ownership, rarity, and transfer verification.
- Provide a delightful UI/UX that mimics real-world habitats.
